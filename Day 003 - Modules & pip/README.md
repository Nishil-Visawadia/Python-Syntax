## Modules

Module is like a code library which can be used to borrow code written by somebody else in our python program. There are two types of modules in python:

1. Built in Modules - These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly. Eg. Every home has Plate and Spoon so they are built in modules. [Built in Modules List](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)
2. External Modules - These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time. Eg. Sometimes we have to bring groceries from store / market so they are external modules.

The above examples are for reference.

## pip Command

It can be used as a package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install a python module.

```Python
pip install module_name
```

Eg. Lets install a module called pandas using the following command.

```Python
pip install pandas
```
